            <h2>History of Coffee</h2>
            
            <h3>Origins of Coffee</h3>
            <p>The journey of coffee begins in the ancient coffee forests of Ethiopia, where legend intertwines with reality. According to popular folklore, a goat herder named Kaldi discovered coffee in the 9th century. Kaldi observed that his goats became unusually lively after consuming the red berries from a certain tree. Intrigued by their energy, Kaldi tried the berries himself and experienced a remarkable boost in vitality.</p>
            <p>Excited by his discovery, Kaldi shared his findings with the local monks, who initially dismissed the berries as a source of mischief. However, when they brewed a drink from the berries and found that it helped them stay awake during long hours of prayer, coffee began its journey from local curiosity to revered beverage.</p>

            <h3>Coffeeâ€™s Global Journey</h3>
            <p>From its Ethiopian origins, coffee made its way to the Arabian Peninsula by the 15th century. The first coffeehouses, known as <i>qahveh khaneh</i>, emerged in cities like Mecca and Medina, serving as social hubs for conversation and community. As coffee gained popularity, it spread to Persia and the Ottoman Empire, further solidifying its cultural significance.</p>
            <p>By the 17th century, coffee reached Europe, where it faced both admiration and criticism. Coffeehouses opened in major cities, becoming vibrant centers for intellectual discussion, art, and commerce. This period marked the birth of the "penny universities," where patrons could engage in lively debate for the price of a cup of coffee. Notably, the beverage was often referred to as the "bitter invention of Satan" by detractors who believed it stimulated rebellious thoughts. Despite the controversy, coffee's popularity soared, with many people embracing its invigorating effects.</p>
            <p>The coffee trade expanded significantly during this time, leading to the establishment of plantations in the Caribbean, Central and South America. By the 18th century, Brazil emerged as a leading coffee producer, and its vast plantations shaped the global coffee market.</p>
