            <h2>Types of Coffee Beans</h2>
            <p>Coffee beans are classified into several varieties, but the two most prominent types are Arabica and Robusta. Each variety has distinct characteristics that influence flavor, aroma, and overall quality.</p>

            <h3>Arabica Coffee</h3>
            <p>Arabica coffee, scientifically known as <i>Coffea arabica</i>, accounts for about 60-70% of the worldâ€™s coffee production. It is grown at higher altitudes, typically between 2,000 and 6,000 feet, in regions with cooler temperatures and abundant rainfall. Arabica beans are known for their smooth, mild flavor and nuanced aroma, often featuring hints of sweetness, fruitiness, or floral notes. They generally have lower caffeine content than Robusta beans and a higher acidity, contributing to a more complex taste profile. Arabica plants are also more susceptible to pests and diseases, making them more challenging to cultivate.</p>

            </div>

            <h3>Robusta Coffee</h3>
            <p>Robusta coffee, on the other hand, is derived from <i>Coffea canephora</i> and represents approximately 30-40% of global coffee production. Robusta beans are typically grown at lower altitudes and are more resilient to harsh weather conditions and pests. As a result, they are easier and cheaper to cultivate. The flavor of Robusta coffee is often described as earthy and bitter, with a stronger, more robust taste compared to Arabica. It contains higher caffeine levels, contributing to a more pronounced bitterness. Robusta is commonly used in instant coffee and espresso blends due to its rich crema and affordability.</p>

            <h3>Coffee Bean Growing Regions</h3>
            <p>The growth and flavor of coffee beans are heavily influenced by their geographic origins. Coffee is cultivated in the "Bean Belt," a region located between the Tropics of Cancer and Capricorn, encompassing parts of Africa, Asia, and the Americas. Key coffee-growing regions include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Central and South America:</strong> Countries such as Colombia, Brazil, Costa Rica, and Guatemala are renowned for their high-quality Arabica coffee.
